Meetup Event:

## Building Virtual Worlds With Ranvier And NodeJS
* led by: Sean O'Donohue
* duration: 45 minutes
* abstract: Have you ever found yourself lost in the rich fantasy worlds of multiplayer games such as the modern classic World of Warcraft, or the now-ancient single-player text games like Zork? Maybe you just want to build something cool and learn about JavaScript and game design. I was once like you and I found a way to scratch this itch by reviving and helping to rewrite an abandoned NodeJS framework for building MUDs. Now I am one of the primary contributors to Ranvier, a NodeJS framework for building multiplayer online virtual worlds in a flexible and moddable way.

In this session, we will leverage Ranvier to create the Zork-WoW-hybrid of your dreams.  Do you want to create a sprawling story? Make it so! A devious trap-filled dungeon? Code it up! A fantastical foreign land filled with giant multi-stage boss battles? Excelsior! Along the way, we will learn about the history of MUDs/MMOs, some of the concepts behind Ranvierâ€™s extensible engine, and how to get started on building the game world of your dreams!
