# Detroit JavaScript Meetup May 2017


## Level Up From Hardware Noob to Hardware Node
* led by: Gabrielle Crevecoeur
* duration: 20 minutes
* abstract: Go one step beyond the browser and leverage your existing JavaScript skills to explore the possibilities of hardware. Do you have an Arduino gathering dust, just waiting for an application beyond the hello world of blinking an LED? Itâ€™s time to take that hardware off the shelf, and learn how to create interactive experiences in the physical world. This session will explore how to utilize the popular Node robotics frameworks to control an Arduino, showing you how to get quickly up and running in this new and emerging world of hardware. In this session, we will go over how to get started in building a NodeBot, and then we will demo an actual NodeBot project. This is an ideal introductory session for those curious on how to get started with some of the popular microcontrollers and microprocessors using JavaScript.
