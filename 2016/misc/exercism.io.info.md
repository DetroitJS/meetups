# Exercism.io info

Regarding exercism.io, these pages give setup information:

- [http://exercism.io/how-it-works/newbie](http://exercism.io/how-it-works/newbie)
- [http://exercism.io/how-it-works](http://exercism.io/how-it-works)

Essentially, you use your GitHub login. Then you set up the CLI (command-line client) on your local machine, which allows you to fetch or submit assignments from/to exercism.io. (There's a configuration step for the CLI involving an API key.)

Both the JavaScript and EcmaScript tracks use Node.js. In general, in the JavaScript track you can code to whatever level of JavaScript your local installation of Node.js supports, but many people (I'm one of them) in the JavaScript track voluntarily/intentionally constrain their code to ES5. In the EcmaScript track, you use Babel to transpile, so you can use whatever latest features Babel currently supports. Many people in that track use the exercises to play around with ES6/ES2015 features.

In general, you work on assignments locally, submit them to exercism.io. At that point your code becomes public to anyone else who has completed that same assignment in that track. You also get to see everyone else's solution to that assignment in that track. If you're not interested in the public aspect of the site you can also just go grab it all from GitHub and work on the assignments locally. But I personally recommend the public approach. I've received a lot of valuable feedback on my code.

If you're part of a team, you can access a team page where you can see every all other team members' exercises in all languages (and they can see yours) regardless of what you've completed. Checking this page is currently the best way to see teammates' new submissions.

(You used to receive notifications of other team members' submissions, but that appears to be turned off currently.)

I went ahead and created a team called "Detroit JavaScript Meetup user group." Anyone who wants to join the team please send me your username in an email (matola at sbcglobal dot net). There's a wonky invitation process to join a team, so I'll send you an invite. (I actually received an error responding to my own invite, but I'm still on the team!) If anyone else wants to join me as an admin for the team, please send me a PM and I'll add you.

Happy coding!
