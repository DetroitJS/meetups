# Detroit JavaScript Meetup May, 2016

## My node cli adventure
  * led by: [Chris DeMars](http://chrisdemars.com)
  * abstract: My small journey, with help or course, to build a cli tool in node, the struggles, and ES6. Don't talk about it, be about it, and just build the damn thing!

## stop bikeshedding and use npm as your task runner
  * led by: [Vince Speelman](http://vinspee.me)
  * abstract: Reduce dependencies and simplify the build pipeline by using the task runner that's built into your package manager. Create a tight feedback loop of `change -> compile -> test ùÑá` without needless abstraction.

## Fun with JavaScript arrays
  * led by: Michael Matola
  * abstract: Programmatically filling a JavaScript array with values (without using for loops or external libraries), or, the one useful use of the Array constructor (mit apply() special sauce), or, ES6/ES2015 makes this less ugly.
