# Submitting a Talk

To submit a talk create a PR to the month that you're interested in. For example, if you're interested in doing a talk for January 2017 then submit a PR to `2017/January.md`.

Your talk submission should be in the following format:

```
## {Talk Title}
* Led by: {name}
* Duration: {duration} minutes
* Abstract: {description}
* Resources: (if applicable)
  * [Resource one](#)
  * [Resource two](#)
```

***There will be 5 minutes added for Q+A to every talk. Minimum talk: 10 minutes. Maximum talk: 60 minutes.***

If you have resources that go along with your talk, we encourage you to include then with your PR or create an additional PR after your talk. Resources should be hosted outside of this repository. Legacy resources have been included as a fallback.
